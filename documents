The word big data usually accompanied prediction rather explanation allows researcher basically squeeze everything data interaction terms transformations polynomials etc without thinking much finding clear explanatory relationship outcome target dependent variable predictors covariates The aim usually give freedom scientist researcher terms features functional forms include equation From lasso svm random forest gbm nn see main aim prediction Question nowadays whether use powerful methods understand causal relationships Large enough needs processed distributed manner As I understand it big data data can t fit memory Big Data also family tools techniques dealing data distributed system although presence system usually data big fit analysts computer s memory There grey area might data that s big memory still use online chunking algorithms get piecemeal Pretty big If I remember VVV definition Volume big fit regular computer Velocity increasing updating quickly Variety multiple data types In one classes professor defined data fit cannot processed single personal standard computer Yes still technically ambiguous lot defined I ever heard it Big Data means data easily process analyse current infrastructure Little cynical I around Teradata claimed Big Data environment It s really executive buzzword like Tiger Teaming What think Big Data today big tomorrow That IoT tsunami way In

TB size data stores quite painful run normal SQL queries against I d say want start running Spark jobs I think there s true definition it I define size data main one main challenges working it To

determinant initially perhaps since daily run batch processing dominant but field matured expectations rose natural number determinants also grew Is data blue Is data binary Then big data Serious answer Big Data data can t fit single computer locally Medium Data things big single person reasonably view interpret When I hear term big data I assume people telling havent got data science experience That person data hustler I always vviewed dependent tech used Things like spark I think big data big work reasonable amount time personal computer Once start needing process train model distributed way big data I always get sense big data means scale data collected analysis done complex enough requires different regime consideration methods accomplish things data For example GMail

enough data canâ€™t fit memory one machine use tools process parallel A definition I like The data big efficiently processed SQL database basically bigger able load whole dataset typical machine s

need special tools deal it x200B It s necessarily mainly dealing large quantities data dealing lot data that s relevant task extracting insights data meant provide collected x200B I m sure though personal impression plenty use cases sheer size data really main challenge It s relative environment If environment limited aspects resources e g credit card chip 1MB data big it lawful evil interpretation insprired deep neural nets dataset one one data point big data like NN one layer deep In average DAX Company big data begins 100 rows excel It s skills come along dealing data The

data them even one tehcniques Big Data help address properties It s always Volume Velocity huge amount data coming fast It variety parse make uniform data disparate sources different formats It Veractiy data quesitonable sources needs introspection circumspect analysis results trusted BigData dataset fit Excel sheet I think mainly refers amount data size Like 50K images dog training

There hard and fast standards working rule thumb easily provision VM enough RAM fit entire data set probably big data That standard obviously change time right probably low terabytes You know realm big data start running serious technical limitations In practice I ve found many data scientists work small data a tens gigabytes fairly basic business analytics That s still enormously useful valuable thing do qualitatively different kind heavy lifting might need Hadoop ecosystem for I think difference too big fit main memory use something like spark efficiently process it accurate answer whatever business wants mean Big enough need cluster hortizontal scaling parallelization perform ETL processess meaningful timeframe This could huge files need processed daily overnight smaller files need processed instantly streaming There s set data size that s considered Big Data In fact one point back 90s 1 gigabyte considered big data can imagine However typical company small medium sized business market access nearly 200 terabytes data Usually businesses harnessing fraction create innovative advantages Some big data services include auditing existing data whether HR CRM etc make sure missed opportunities could leveraging data already set new data collection points needed automate analysis big data analytics require constant effort monitoring rather often goes hand in hand artificial intelligence machine learning Certified Professional Data Engineers automate process data collection analysis setting data engineering pipelines directly get processed information instead go gigabytes data More info Data huge misnomer Let tell someone 20 years experience data engineer using SQL Databases Spark Hadoop NoSQL I got Hadoop Spark MongoDb side things short hype novelty I thought cool month I realized garbage tools 99 time Let s start data stored relational database Let s say I table one column only Sales contains 32 bit integer type Let s say I 10 billion records table number values averaging 1000000000 one billion How much space take Each number stored binary format takes 4 bytes 4 bytes x 10 billion 40 000 000 000 bytes 40 gb That s 40 gigs Now let s store number JSON format It contains metadata tag column Sales 1000000000 Since stored plain text record takes 19 bytes So table weighs 190 gigs already Queries response times suck single node big data servers answer problem horizontally scale data meaning make copies data across many servers needed gain better throughput parallel processing That s pretty much Hadoop does So let s assume we re going light 5 nodes That s 190x5 950 gigs We re almost terabyte territory already puny 40 gb dataset already taking almost terabyte storage big data system Keep mind quite 100 node Hadoop clusters there 100 nodes scenario 19 terabytes That s right 40 g 19 terabytes Now THAT s big data Many years ago I created data warehouse large credit card company weighed less 20 g yet contained records call volumes company worldwide I learned since moved Hadoop because according them manage several terabytes data exact application Now I know fact call volumes multiply factor millions extra data come from My guess extra data inefficiency So question is When big data appropriate use Let illustrate scenario If go Library Congress 16 million books interested reading books Michael Lewis go online terminal even card catalog look books author name find Michael Lewis it ll tell exactly go In less 3 minutes already browsing books If library double number books have would still take roughly time find books That s data storage SQL Database Now imagine instead library come across huge warehouse massive 16 million pile books center Not books newspapers lead pipes old shoes etc Now want find Michael Lewis books there Well could dig search book one one all would take years Instead hire 100 high school kids sort books you With 100 people 100 times faster If hire 200 kids even faster But even people it ll take days still that s nature work doing But really viable way finding books absence cataloging shelving system That s big data In scenarios above smart money moves data Hadoop SQL Database Like 200 kids organize books catalog you You that card catalog helps find books minutes again But I m seeing alot people dismantling library chucking books big pile keep hiring 200 kids find books need every time need it They decommission SQL databases move Hadoop Spark MongoDb suffer horrific response times result When numbers start measured illions Every single tweet world Too big fit excel spreadsheet Big data refers tools used volume data A big company huge SQL server database billions records big data A smaller company smaller volume data manager via Hadoop cluster big data More million rows',
